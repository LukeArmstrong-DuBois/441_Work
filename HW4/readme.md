This assignment really let me dive deeper into creating a choose-your-own-adventure story and utilizing Javascript to improve the player experience. Imputing text to make decisions gives a much more hands-on experience with the narrative, and it really adds to the story. 

Checking for specific words to progress the story was more challenging than using buttons, but I got the hang of it after spending some time experimenting. 

I'm really happy with the inventory system I implemented, which checks if the player made certain decisions before letting them beat the game. I think it adds a layer of complexity that my first choose-your-own-adventure story didn't have. 

I had quite a bit of trouble getting the restart button to work. I originally wanted the player to type "restart after beating the game and have them take back to the first choice of the game, but I was unable to figure it out. I ended up with a button that stayed for the whole story and looked pretty unappealing. 

Apart from that though, I learned a lot and had fun with this assignment.

This time around, the AI-generated version of the assignment actually provided me with new insights into what you can do with Javascript, which I will definitely include in future projects.
