            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a Media Arts major and this is my senior year. i'm looking to grauate winter 2025. I've been able to use what I learned from college to find some contracting work making informational videos for local non-profits. I also was an AmeriCorps volunteer for two summers, which was an awesome experience.</p>
            <p>Honors: I got on the dean's and president's list a few times</p>

            <h2>My Interests</h2>
            <p>I really like yoga, playing piano, and playing video games.</p>
            <p>A great memory that I have of playing video games is the Minecraft world my brother and I added to for over four years. It was a creative superfast world where we built houses, pixel art, and battle arenas whenever we had free time. We recently went back and explored this world over ten years later, which was a very fun and nostalgic experience.</p>

            <h2>Pressing Issue Today</h2>
            <p>I think that a very pressing issue that affects the world at large is the lack of understanding people have for one another.</p> 
            <p>If people were exposed to differing world views and stepped out of their echo chambers, they would see that our differences are far smaller than our similarities. This would not only make the world a more accepting and tolerant place but also make people think about fear-mongering techniques that do nothing more than build an "us vs. them" mindset.</p>
            <p>I think that video games can help fix this problem by unifying players together so they are forced to interact with people from backgrounds and cultures different from their own.</p>
