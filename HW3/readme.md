I again used Copiolet to generate the assignment and see what it came up with. Like last time, the AI-generated assignment was technologically robust but felt bland due to the sack of human touch. Using AI has helped me learn more techniques to incorporate into my own code. 

While working on this project, one of the biggest problems I encountered was making the age check. I originally wanted the page to be hidden from the viewer and only reveal itself after confirming that someone is over 18. However, the finished product on the site is much more simplistic and only changes the displayed text. 

On the other hand, the creation of the rest of the page went very smoothly. I was able to build my own adventure story that included an interesting plot while also making it stylish and functional. I have made Choose Your Own Adventure stories in the past, but the use of jave made the workload a lot lighter and kept all the work on one page.
