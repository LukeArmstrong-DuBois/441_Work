Using Copilot to generate a page was a lot faster than working on my own. With a simple prompt, I had a fully styled page that included Java in moments. However, I noticed that the AI didn't add any interesting stylistic decisions or background to its "favorite things." This is one of the biggest weaknesses of AI that I've noticed in using it over the past few years; most of the time, the generated material will only do the bare minimum and spit out something that is extremely bland. 

Some of the most fun I have while coding is adding new things just because I think it would be cool to have on the page. For writing code that would take hours to do by hand, I can totally see the benefit to the tech, but that should not replace the human creativity that is included on every page.
