Using jQuery really helped me add elements to my pages without needing to manually write them all. The page I made has a lot of elements that fade in and out constantly, and jQuery paired with arrays helped me make something that looks cool in an efficient package. 

I had a little bit of trouble getting the moving images and moving shapes to appear on the same level of the page, but after some tweaking, I found the problem and made the moving elements uniform. 

The AI-generated version of the assessment was pretty solid and actually included some interesting words of encouragement, but I think my version is more genuine and has a fixed theme, which adds to the project.
