This assessment went really well and helped reinforce my understanding of JSON. I found a list of Pokemon and their stats looking at the "cool datasets" and included that on my page. It shows up in a really clean way and includes a lot of information. Having over 4000 lines of code displayed on one page is very cool and is the most complex project I've ever made, size-wise. My pluginÂ does a good job of breaking down all the information and making it easy to read and display. I liked that this assignment was more free-form, as it allowed me to really think about what I wanted to create.
