This project went really smoothly and provided me with many useful tools for improving my projects in the future. 

While there is a lot of content on the page, the objects only being used when needed help make the code more legible and allow for debugging and maintenance in the future. My older websites had lines of code-breaking three digits, but this page kept the number low by using the techniques taught on the course website. 

The social justice theme was also a good way to make the project reflect my beliefs and world views while also showcasing my understanding of coding. 

This week, the AI produced something very boring. The social justice themes the AI chose were very broad, and their descriptions didn't contain much substance. Like always thought, looking at the code and the descriptions provided by the AI taught me a lot.
