This project went very smoothly for me and provided me with a lot of helpful new tools I can use in future projects. The use of arraysÂ was very valuable in creating and displaying the image boxes without needing to make each one individually. 

I think adding checks to see if the frogs match and re-hiding them if they don't would make the experience more like a game, so adding that in the future is a goal of mine. 

The AI-generated version of the assignment was bland, but I enjoyed asking the chatbot to describe specific portions of the code so I could learn more. The way the AI breaks it down works well with how I like to learn and is much quicker than watching a 15-minute YouTube video.
