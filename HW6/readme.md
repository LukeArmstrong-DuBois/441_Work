This project really helped me deepen my knowledge of tracking items as the player progressed through the game. Compared to my first matching game, the one I made this week is much more complex and acts more like a game than a showcase of arrays. I added my own stylistic touch to the project by making it about a game series that I love.

I was having a lot of trouble working the game over three pages, but I was able to showcase the information I collected from the player through a pop-up alert. 

The AI-generated assignment was bare-bones and unappealing but filled with a bunch of useful strategies to clean up my code. The use of AI also helped me figure out how to reset my question mark image after the player incorrectly made a guess. This makes the process of playing the game simpler and adds to the look of the website.
