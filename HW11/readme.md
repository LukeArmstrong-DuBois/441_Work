This project was very fun to create and helped me fully understand the utility of HTML5. I ended up making a little game-like experience where the player has to dodge squares that shrink them but chase after one that grows them. 

With a little bit of refining, like changing the player and enemy icons to something more unique and adding a scoring system that keeps track of how long the player has been big, this project could be a fun little game. 

I had some trouble getting my MP3 file to play as soon as the page loaded, so I just used a button for the viewer to interact with so they can pick and choose when they want the song. Apart from that, this week went really smoothly, and I was able to slowly add to the project to create something cool.
